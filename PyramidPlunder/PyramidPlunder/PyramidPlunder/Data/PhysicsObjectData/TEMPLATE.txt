#X- & Y- COORDINATES ON COLLISION GRID
#A collision point will be created from each possible pair of one x-coordinate
#listed below and one y-coordinate listed below. Thus if there are X x-coordinates
#listed and Y y-coordinates listed below, there will be X * Y collision points
#created for this object.
#Values will be separated only by a single space, so no commas, semicolons, etc.
#The values will preferably be arranged in increasing order, but at the very
#least they will be arranged such that the smallest value is first and the
#largest value is last.
#
#X-COORDINATES ON SPRITE WHICH HAVE COLLISION POINTS
#When these values are arranged in increasing order, the greatest difference between
#two consecutive values will be no more than *15*.

#
#Y-COORDINATES ON SPRITE WHICH HAVE COLLISION POINTS
#When these values are arranged in increasing order, the greatest difference between
#two consecutive values will be no more than *33*.
